# seedchanger_with_username
These files are changes to [evaisa's seedchanger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2284931352), in order to enter username into Noita.

First download SeedChanger by subscribing to the workshop mod SeedChanger, linked above.
Then, to edit the seedchanger mod from Noita workshop, open C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\881100\2284931352
(Note: If you use a different drive for your Steam Library, navigate there instead of C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam)

Edit or replace both of init.lua and settings.lua with the code from this repository.

Name seed will override the numerical seed.
Name and seed will be shown for one minute, then go away...unless you toggle for it to stay on indefinitely. This display can be changed mid run.
